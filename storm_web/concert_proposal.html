<h1> Noelle's Dream Concert Proposal  </h1>


<p> For my dream concert, I propose an all female line up, of international women who sing and promote different social and political movements. My lineup is comprised of Beyonce (Lemonade) for the Black Feminist movement,  Helly Luv who is a Kurdish Propaganda singer against ISIS,  MIA with Borders (about the struggles of racism against immigrants), Pussy Riot, who are a group of female guerrilla performers against sexism and Vladimir Putin’s dictatorship, and finally, Lady Gaga who stands up for the LGBTQ+ community. I chose these artist because of the strength and determination they show when speaking and performing for their causes. I’ve decided to market the concert as “GUERRILLA ANTHEMS” because of how these women use irregular tactics of ambush on these social and political issues. It will be held on March 8th, 2017, otherwise known as international women’s day. It will be held at Shoreditch Town Hall in London. I chose London because it is a central location for all the artist, as well as a huge hub of discussion for global issues. I chose the town hall to fit with the idea of overthrowing old politics, and having a social revolution fueled by their music.
