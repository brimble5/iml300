   Pussy Riot's two lead sings, Nadezha Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina seem to be very keen on crossing the line. The two started in 2013, speaking out about feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, and their opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The two encouraged people to look at what Russia had become, and start to move towards change, however soon they were imprisioned for speaking out against the President. Never the less the group has been released as is coming out with new songs, faster than ever. Recently, they have come out with "Make America Great Again" and "Straight Out Of Vagina" as commentaries to the President-elect, Donald Trump. The Group has gain considerable popularity, forging a path for musical propoganda.
