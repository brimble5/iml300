<h1> ABOUT PUSSY RIOT </h1>


<p> Pussy Riot is a Russian feminist punk rock protest group based in Moscow. Founded in August 2011, it had a variable membership of approximately 11 women[1] ranging in age from about 20 to 33 (as of 2012).[2] The group staged unauthorised provocative guerrilla performances in unusual public places, which were made into music videos and posted on the Internet.[3] The collective's lyrical themes included feminism, LGBT rights, and opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom the group considered to be a dictator.[2] These themes also encompassed Putin's links to the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church.[4]
