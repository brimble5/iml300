<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>


<p> I love dogs, and have recently became a cat person as well. I like to swim, to watch movies, and to eat or cook with my friends. My favorite foods include, Gluten free pizza -I'm allergic-, GF cookies, donuts, cakes, and random health smoothies.
</p>

<h2>I dislikes include Math, running, country music, rude people, and Tim Burton movies. </h2> 

<h3>My preferred creative media is film and video, however I am curious to get involved with interactive media and virtual reality. </h3>
