<p>
    My name is Noelle Brimble, and I am a story-teller, designer, technologist, and activist. I am lucky enough to be majoring in Media Arts + Practice, at USC, which is a multi-platform media design program, focused on using emerging technology for story-telling. 
    
    Over the past year and a half, I have been learning the Abode Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premier) from the top designers and editors in the field, who constantly push me to be more innovative and creative than my last project. I am currently taking a creative coding class for the web, as well as a class on the fundamentals of media design. In this class I am focusing on building a personal brand and aesthetic on Illustrator, as well as studying the impacts of different forms of media on the internet. We are also learning about product and packaging design, by re-branding and designing new packaging for popular childrenâ€™s dolls. 
    
    I started coding in Spring 2016, and have grown to enjoy it as well. I am fluent in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as Processing (Java), which is used for animation and computational art. I would love to gain more experience in web design. 
    
    In all of my classes, my professors stress the importance of concept, visualization, documentation, and execution; therefore, I feel confident in my organization skills, and theory based practice for all of my work. 
    
I am a natural leader, a national award winning public speaker, am passionate about activism, and enjoy working in groups. I believe that it is essential to listen and communicate when working on a job, and to always show appreciation and respect for your fellow workers. I hope I can be a part of a team, where I will grow as an artist and a person, from innovative people from around the world.
